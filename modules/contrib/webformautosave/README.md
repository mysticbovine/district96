### About this Module

The goal of this module is to make it possible to automatically save a draft of 
a webform whenever a jQuery change event is detected on an input or select 
element on the form. The module uses jQuery to detect the load and change events and fire 
AJAX calls to each of these endpoints appropriately.

### Configuration

Once you enable the module, go to your webform's general settings page 
and enable the auto-save feature under the third-party settings section.
